blocknlp/object_list is storing both the new and old locations of the blocks:
	r: 0.208276 g: 0.167100 b: 0.167100
	H: 0.000000
	(0)_red
	r: 0.181915 g: 0.149020 b: 0.149020
	H: 0.000000
	(1)_red
	r: 0.197668 g: 0.161314 b: 0.804558
	H: 243.391004
	2_purple
	r: 0.832574 g: 0.147647 b: 0.147647
	H: 0.000000
	3_red

The old data is being read into pr2_commander with the new data so it is displaying extra objects. Sometimes it states that the robot is still holding onto an object when it isn't.
In object_manager, which is publishing to blocknlp/object_list, previously detected objects that have not been updated are not being removed.

In pr2_commander, the infer action button only occassionally works. Sometimes it prints the following error message:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/andyh/brown-mit-pr2-nlu/3rdParty/slu/slu/build/lib/python2.7/pr2/gui/pr2CommanderGui.py", line 94, in inferAction
