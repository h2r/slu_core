Sugar and Spice Cookies
http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sugar-and-spice-cookies/detail.aspx

1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
1 pinch ground cloves
1/2 cup softened butter
1 cup packed brown sugar 
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1. Mix the flour, the baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves together in a bowl. 2. Cream the butter and brown sugar together with an electric mixer in a large bowl
until smooth; beat the egg and vanilla extract into the butter mixture. Add the flour mixture in small amount to the butter mixture, beating each addition until blended. Form the dough into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.
3. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease baking sheets.
4. Roll the dough out on a floured work surface with a rolling pin to about 1/8-inch
thickness. Cut with 2-inch cookie cutters. Arrange the cut cookies onto the
prepared baking sheets.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges begin to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow
the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
