Remove initial state from kitchenState.py
Formalize ALL the recipes *Wait until later in the week to do this.
Finish planningLanguage.py
Get eval() working
Convert strings of formal actions to action objects (AnnotatedRecipe)
Write a recipe loader?

Python conventions
Add null actions to recipe annotations
use former implementation of prism_from_point
tests in unit test need to start with lowercase "test" - fix names of tests
PlanningLanguage
	Have targetBowl always be specified.

-Write an evaluator to check the sequence of state-action pairs to see how accurate they are
Evaluator:
	State Equivilancy Checker
	Use AnnotatedRecipe/PlanningLanguage to get proper sequences of State-Action pairs
	The inference method needs an initial state (from the recipe file) and the recipe text
	A metric to judge the performance of a path (Comparing each state/milestone states/end result/etc)

Take out all extra prism_from_point in kitchenState



Questions:
Should I store the state(s) in a PlanningLanguage and/or AnnotatedRecipe? Both! I need to keep track of the 
	groups of states that correspond to a single annotation.
Each action should have its own class? Or share a formalActions class? - Share a PlanningLanguage class
